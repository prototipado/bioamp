### About project
BioAmp is an opensource project of a multichannel biopotential adquisition system for EEG, EMG, EOG and EOG signals.

The device has 8 programmable channels - 2000 Hz maximun sampling frequency, allowing the acquisition of biopotentials.

### Features

- Resolution: 17 - 19 bits depending on settings (gain and sampling frequency).
- Channels: 8 differential channels / 8 monopolar channels.
- Input Impedance: ‚â• 500 M Œ©
- Dimentions: 153x114x34mm
