BioAmp is an opensource project of a multichannel biopotential adquisition system for EEG, EMG, EOG and EOG signals.

The device has 8 programmable channels - 2000 Hz maximun sampling frequency, allowing the acquisition of biopotentials.

Features:

Resulution: 17 - 19 bits depending on settings (gain and sampling frequency).
Channels: 8 differential channels / 8 monopolar channels.
Input Impedance: ≥ 500 M Ω
Dimentions: 153x114x34mm
